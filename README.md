## About Me
Hi! My name is Ariel Sanders and I am currently a student at Front Range Community College. I moved to Longmont in 2021 with my parter and our four cats, and we love it here! Some of my hobbies including reading, swimming, and traveling
## School Experience
I am currently in school at FRCC. I am scheduled to complete the Database Administration certificate at the end of the Spring 2025 semester, and am on track to finish the Database Administration Associates degree in Spring of 2026! I previously attended Joliet Junior College back in Illinois and got an Associated of Arts in 2021.
## Work Experience
I have been in the service industry since I was 18 years old. I have done everything from working in the kitchen to managing. I currently am a shift lead at The Roost in Longmont, CO. My current responsibilities include: training new staff, managing the floor, issuing voids and comps, and redirecting employees to create an efficient work space. I do these things while also being in charge of my own section and creating enjoyable experiences for customers and keeping track of customer checks on our point of sales system.
